### Changed

- Reworked the script output using unicode characters.

### Removed

- Removed the check "types" ("info"/"vuln") as this information was redundant with the severity.

## 2023-08-13

- Check random module names with a regex to ensure they contain only a-z letters.

## 2023-07-02

## 2023-07-01

### Changed

- The "PrintNightmare" check was fully renamed as "Point and Print configuration", which is more accurate. The code was also completely refactored. The tests that are implemented for the different variants of the exploit should also be more reliable.

### Fixed

- Two of the registry keys in the Point & Print configuration check were incorrect.

## 2023-06-18

- For each phantom DLL, a link to the (original?) source describing its discovery and exploitation is now provided.

### Changed

- A check's compliance result is no longer a Boolean. It is now represented as a String ("True", "False", "N/A").
- In HTML reports, the "Compliance" result is handled similarly to "Severity" levels, using a label.

## 2023-02-18

### Added

- Services > Invoke-ThirdPartyDriverCheck, for enumerating third-party drivers.

## 2023-02-18

### Changed

- Modified the Process access rights enumeration to bypass Cortex AMSI detection (AMSI rule flagging the string "CreateThread" as malicious).

### Fixed

- The info check now shows the correct product name when running on Windows 11.

## 2022-11-07

## 2022-11-06

### Added

- Misc > Invoke-ExploitableLeakedHandlesCheck

### Changed

- Added a cache for user group SIDs and deny SIDs. Deny SIDs in particular caused a significant overhead in Get-ModifiablePath. The performance gain is substantial.

### Fixed

### Changed

- The Get-ModifiablePath and Get-ModifiableRegistryPath cmdlets now use the generic Get-ModificationRight cmdlet.
- Deny ACEs are now taken into account when checking DACLs.
